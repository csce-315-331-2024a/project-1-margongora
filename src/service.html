                    <ul>
                        <li>I currently work at the Zachry Engineering Labs, hosting the lab sessions for ENGR 216/217 labs.</li>
                        <li>I explain concepts of engineering and physics to the students, and supervise them utilizing the machines in class to put those concepts to work.</li>
                        <li>I also host office hours and meet with students as needed, to answer any questions they may have for their lab reports and about the concepts.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I've taken part within the Big Event, one of the biggest student volunteering efforts in the nation. I gave back to my community, just as its given to me.</li>
                        <li>This was accomplished through cleaning up one of the properties within town, and helping the owners' with whatever they needed for the day.</li>

                    <li>Mentoring</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I would love to be able to mentor a younger student.</li>
                        <li>I'd hope that I could help them to love the campus more, as well as gain a bigger passion for the subject they're trying to study.</li>
                        <li>I believe that my experience here at Texas A&M would serve me in this position, especially if my field interests matched up with the mentee, as I could give advice that they could use to great benefit.</li>

                    <li>Tutoring</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I would also enjoy being able to tutor one or many students.</li>
                        <li>I'm quite skilled within Calculus, C++ and Python languages, all things that many students have trouble with, especially with the more complex ideas.</li>
                        <li>Personally, I would love to do this during my senior year to help students grasp concepts that they have trouble with.</li>
